# Team_Lifing_Log
Workout app that determines a user's one rep maximum for different exercises.

Written in Java, this application allows users to enter the weight they used for an exercise and the amount of reps that they performed. These variables are then used to calculate the user's one rep maximum using The Brzycki (1993) equation:
Weight รท (1.0278 - (0.0278 ร Number of repetitions))

Once the calculation is carried out, the numeric value and the date that the exercise was logged is added to a graph for visualization.
